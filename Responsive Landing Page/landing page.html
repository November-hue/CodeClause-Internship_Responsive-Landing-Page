                <h3>Step 1: Project Inception</h3>
                <p>During the Inception phase, the November Tech team dedicates itself to thoroughly uncovering everything about your 
				organization—from core values to short and long-term objectives.
 We believe in deeply understanding your business before embarking on crafting your digital footprint. 
This discovery process hinges on mutual transparency and unwavering dedication from both parties involved. </p>

            <div class="feature-item">
                <h3>Step 2: User Interface and Experience Design </h3>
                <p>After completing the Inception phase, we commence our creative journey. 
				Understanding that each client and their requirements are unique, our in-house UX/UI designer initiates by identifying valuable existing elements such as logos, 
				typefaces, colors, and the current website. 
				From there, we begin shaping and refining the visual brand that best represents your vision.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Website Development</h3>
                <p>Development occurs concurrently in most cases, with the design team working on
the HTML/CSS templates for all pages, views, modules and features of the website
– while the development team begins building the database schema, framework
and installation(s) that occur prior to design integration.</p>
